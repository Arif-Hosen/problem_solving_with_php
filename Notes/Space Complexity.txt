####-- Space Complexity ---####
Space complexity is an important things when we make a solution of a program. When a machine 
execute a program it requires memory spaces. So we need to make an efficient algorithm of a 
program.

Space Complexity-
Space Complexity is total amount of memory takes to execute a program of the algorithm.
There are 3 reasons to used memory of a algorithm- 
	1) Instrunction Space
	2) Environmental Stack
	3) Data Space
 *** We are consider only Data Space while writing an algorithm.
Data Space-\
Some space are required during execute a program to store constant and variables values.

2 ways to calculation space complexity of an algorithm- 1) Constant 2) Linear

here, we need to know the value of memory used for different types of data type of variables.
	-> integer variable require 4 bytes of memory space
	-> float variable require 4 bytes of memory space
	-> double variable require 8 bytes of memory space


* O(1) - Constant space complexity considered when a algorithm doesn't contain any loop, recursive
function and function call.

ex:1
 {
   int r = a * b * c * d * e;
   return(r);
}

Above example, we see a, b, c, d, e and r are integer types. Thoose are take 4 bytes memory. and 
4 bytes for return value.
So space is required- (4 * 6) + 4 = 28 bytes. Fixed amount of space need for all inputs. So, it is a Constant 
Space Complexity.


* O(n) -Linear space complexity considered when the program depend on numbers of array element. Simply, 
this types of complexity conatins loop.

ex: 2
// n is the length of array a[]
int sub(int arr[], int n)
{
int sub = 0;  // 4 bytes for sub
int sum = 0;  // 4 bytes for sum
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) // 4 bytes for i
{  
    sum = sum + arr[i];
    sub = sub - arr[i];  
}
return [sub,sum];
}

-> here, 4*n bytes of space needs for each element of array
-> n, sub, sum ,i values required 4 bytes for each and return values required 8 bytes
So, total amount of memeory is, 4 * n + 4 * 4 + 8 = 4n + 24.  It is increasing with the length of array (n),
S0, this types of complexity is Linear Space Complexity.

When we will design a algorithm, always try to make an algorithm which required less time and space.
